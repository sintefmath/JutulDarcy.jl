# # Adjoint gradients for the SPE1 model
# <tags: Blackoil, HistoryMatching, Differentiability, InputFile>
# This is a brief example of how to set up a case and compute adjoint gradients
# for the SPE1 model in a few different ways. These techniques are in general
# applicable to DATA-type models.

# ## Set up a function to set up the case with custom porosity
# We create a setup function that takes in a parameter dictionary `prm` and
# returns a case with the porosity set to the value in `prm["poro"]`. This is a
# convenient way to customize a case prior to setup, allowing direct interaction
# with keywords like PERMX, PORO, etc.

# permeability, porosity and well indices.
