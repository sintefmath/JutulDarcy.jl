# # Hydrostatic equilibriation of models
# <tags: Immiscible, Compositional, Blackoil, Introduction>
# Initializing a reservoir model is an important part of reservoir simulation.
# For simple, conceptual models it may be sufficient to prescribe a single
# uniform pressure value as the initial condition, but for more realistic cases
# the problem of equilibriation becomes very important.
#
# This example gives an overview of how to set up the initial state of a
# reservoir model using the `setup_reservoir_state` function. To set up a
# reservoir model, values for all primary variables must be provided for every
# cell of the domain. The wells are automatically initialized from the cell
# values. There are two main ways the initial state can be set up:
#
# 1. Direct assignment, where the initial values are provided directly as either
#    values for one cell, or values for all cells in the domain. This has the
#    advantage of being very easy to set up, and gives you full control over the
#    initial conditions, but it can be difficult to set up realistic initial
#    that correspond to hydrostatic equilibrium. This means that the model can
#    have significant mass transfer between cells starting from the initial
#    conditions even without wells or boundary conditions.
# 2. Equilibriation, where the initial values are computed from a set of
#    ordinary differential equations that makes sure the initial state is in
#    hydrostatic equilibrium. This is the most realistic way to set up the
#    initial conditions, but requires additional inputs.
#
# We will go over both of these approaches in this example. The corresponding
# terminology from typical input files would be keywords like EQUIL (for
# hydrostatic equilibriation) and PRES, SGAS, SOIL and so on (for direct
# assignment). If an input file is used, the initial state will set up
# automatically from these keywords.

# ## Set up a reservoir with depth for the examples
# We will use a simple Cartesian mesh with 2 cells in the x-direction and 1000
# cells in the z-direction. The domain is 20 m wide, 10 m high and 1000 m deep.
# Note that we set `z_is_depth = true` to make sure the z coordinate is treated
# as depth, which is customary for resrvoir models, and assumed by the functions
# that set up the initial state based on hydrostatic equilibrium. We also shift
# the mesh so that the top of the domain is at 800 m depth.

# ## Set up a three-phase model with simple initial conditions
# We will start by setting up a three-phase model with simple initial
# conditions. We let the initial conditions be uniform throughout the domain.
# This is done by passing a scalar for the pressure (which will be repeated for
# all cells) and a vector with one entry per hphase for the saturations (which
# will be repeated for all cells into a 3 by ncells matrix).
#
# We also set a typical density function. The density function is important, as
# it determines the pressure distribution for the equilibrium state.

# ### Simulate the model and plot the change in pressure
# We will now simulate the model for 100 years and plot the change in pressure.
# This could be thought of as the poor man's way of setting up the initial
# state, as it will give a pressure distribution that is close to hydrostatic
# equilibrium at the cost of solving many time-steps. For a small model, this
# cost is negligble, but for larger models it can be significant.
#
# We observe that the initially constant pressure becomes a nearly  linear function of
# depth after 100 years. This is the expected result for a model with constant
# and no driving forces other than gravity.

# ## Conclusion
# We have seen how to set up the initial state of a reservoir model using both
# direct assignment and hydrostatic equilibrium. Even a simple model can have
# surprising complexity in how the initial state should be set up. We have not
# covered all the options available (e.g. specifying capillary pressure
# interfaces), but the examples should give a good idea of how to set up your
# own model.
