# # A fully differentiable geothermal doublet: History matching and control optimization
# We are going to set up a conceptual geothermal doublet model in 2D and perform
# gradient based history matching. This example serves two main purposes:
# 1. It demonstrates the conceptual workflow for setting up a geothermal model
#    from scratch with a fairly straightforward mesh setup.
# 2. It shows how to set up a gradient based history matching workflow with the
#    generic optimization interface that allows for optimizing any input
#    parameter used in the setup of a model.

# ## Set up the reservoir mesh
# The model is a typical geothermal case where there is a layer of high
# permeability in the middle, confined between two low-permeable layers. For a
# geothermal model, the low permeable layers are important, as they store
# significant amounts of heat that can be conducted to the high permeable layer
# during production.
#
# We set up the mesh so that the high permeable layer where most of the
# advective transport occurs has a higher lateral resolution than the low
# permeable layers. The model is also essentally 2D as there is only one cell
# thickness in the y direction - a choice that is made to make the example fast
# to run, especially during the later optimization stages where many simulations
# must be run to achieve convergence.

# ## Define functions for setting up the simulation
# We will define a function that takes in a Dict with different values and sets
# up the simulation. The key idea is that we can then optimize the values in the
# Dict to perform optimization. As we can define any such Dict to set up the
# model, this interface is very flexible and can be used for both control
# optimization and history matching with respect to almost any parameter of the
# model. The disadvantage is that the setup function will be called many times,
# which can be a substantial cost compared to the more structured optimization
# interface that only allows for optimization of the numerical parameters (e.g.
# for the CGNet example).

# ### Define the time schedule
# We set up a time schedule for the simulation. The total simulation time is 30
# years, and we report the results every 120 days. We also define ten different
# intervals in this 30 year period, which are the period where we will allow the
# rates and temperatures to vary during the last part of the optimization tutorial.
