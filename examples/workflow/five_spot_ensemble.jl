# # Quarter-five-spot example
# <tags: Immiscible, Introduction>
# The quarter-five-spot is a standard test problem that simulates 1/4 of the
# five spot well pattern by assuming axial symmetry. The problem contains an
# injector in one corner and the producer in the opposing corner, with a
# significant volume of fluids injected into the domain.

# We define a function that, for a given porosity field, computes a solution
# with an estimated permeability field. For assumptions and derivation of the
# specific form of the Kozeny-Carman relation used in this example, see [Lie,
