# # Adding new wells to an existing model
# Taking an existing reservoir model and modifying it with new wells is a
# typical operation in reservoir simulation. This example demonstrates how to
# add new wells to an existing model and a few ways to setup these wells.
#
# The example uses the SPE1 data set as the model. We load the dataset as a
# `JutulCase` as usual and unpack the parts of the problem from the `case`
# before simulating the base case.

# ## Replacing the existing wells with new wells with the same name
# The simplest way to replace a well is to create a new well with the same name
# so that the new well replaces the old one. This is done by calling the setup
# routines and using the same name as the original wells. We place one injector
# and one producer, using the same names as in the original version of the case.
#
# Here, we make use of the `setup_well` function to create the new wells and use
# the cell indices directly.
reservoir = reservoir_domain(model)
I1 = setup_well(reservoir, 1, name = :INJ)
P1 = setup_well(reservoir, 10, name = :PROD)
# ## Add a new producer as multisegment well
# We can also add more wells than originally present by adding new wells with
# new names. Some care will have to be taken later on to ensure that these wells
# have valid control and limits. We pick a cell with a IJK index to place this
# producer.
P2 = setup_well(reservoir, (10, 10, 1), name = :PROD_NEW, simple_well = false)
# ## Add a new injector with a trajectory
# An alternative to placing wells by cell index is to place them by trajectory.
# We can define a trajectory as a set of points in 3D space, here represented as
# a Matrix with three columns where each row represents a point along the
# trajectory. The trajectory is then used to discretize the well into cells.

# ## Set up the new model
# The new model is set up by calling the `setup_reservoir_model` function with
# the old model as the template. This function will create a new model with the
# same properties and customizations as the original model, but with the new
# wells added. The template model takes the place of the `sys` argument seen in
# other examples.

# ## Visualize the new wells and the trajectory
# We can see the new wells and the trajectory by plotting the model. Note that
# the trajectory is connected to cell centers in the numerical model. The coarse
# resolution of the model makes the trajectory appear jagged when realized along
# cells.

# ## Setup a new state and forces
# The new state and forces are set up in the same way as the original model,
# using the previous state0 and forces as templates. The new control and limits
# are duplicated from the old ones, mapping producer controls and limits to
# producers and injector controls and limits to injectors.
#
# We keep the controls of the wells constant throughout the simulation, but we
# could also have made a `forces` Vector with one value per step.
