# # Consistent discretizations: Average MPFA and nonlinear TPFA
# This example demonstrates how to use alternative discretizations for the
# pressure gradient term in the Darcy equation, i.e. the approximation of the
# Darcy flux:
#
# ``\mathbf{}{K}(\nabla p + \rho g \Delta z)``.
#
# It is well-known that for certain combinations of grid geometry and
# permeability fields, the classical two-point flux approximation scheme can
# give incorrect results. This is due to the fact that the TPFA scheme is not a
# formally consistent method when the product of the permeability tensor and the
# normal vector does not align with the cell-to-cell vectors over a face (lack
# of K-orthogonality).
#
# In such cases, it is often beneficial to use a consistent discretization.
# JutulDarcy includes a class of linear and nonlinear schemes that are designed
# to be accurate even for challenging grids.
# 
# For further details on this class of methods, which differ a bit from the
# classical MPFA-O type method often seen in the literature, see
# [schneider_nonlinear](@cite), [zhang_nonlinear](@cite) and
# [raynaud_discretization](@cite).

# ## Define a mesh and twist the nodes
# This makes the mesh non K-orthogonal and will lead to wrong solutions for the
# default TPFA scheme.
