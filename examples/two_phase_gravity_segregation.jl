# # Gravity segregation example
# The simplest type of porous media simulation problem to set up that is not
# trivial is the transition to equilibrium from an unstable initial condition.
# Placing a heavy fluid on top of a lighter fluid will lead to the heavy fluid
# moving down while the lighter fluid moves up. 
#
# ## Problem set up
# We define a simple 1D gravity column with an approximate 10-1 ratio in density
# between the two compressible phases and let it simulate until equilibrium is
# reached. We begin by defining the reservoir domain itself.

# Define two phases liquid and vapor with a 10-1 ratio reference densities and
# set up the simulation model.

# Replace default density with a constant compressibility function that uses the
# reference values at the initial pressure.

# ### Set up initial state
# Put heavy phase on top and light phase on bottom. Saturations have one value
# per phase, per cell and consequently a per-cell instantiation will require a
# two by number of cells matrix as input. We also set up time-steps for the
# simulation, using the provided conversion factor to convert days into seconds.

# We simulate the system using the default linear solver and otherwise default
# options. Using `simulate` with the default options means that no dynamic
# timestepping will be used, and the simulation will report on the exact 150
# steps defined above.

# ## Plot results
# Plot the saturations of the liquid phase at three different timesteps: The
# initial, unstable state, an intermediate state where fluid exchange between
# the top and bottom is initiated, and the final equilibrium state where the
# phases have swapped places.
