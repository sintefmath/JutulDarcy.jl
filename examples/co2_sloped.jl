# # Carbon dioxoide injection in aquifer
# This example demonstrates a custom K-value compositional model for the
# injection of CO2 into a saline aquifer. The physical model for flow of CO2 is
# a realization of the description in [11th SPE Comparative Solutions
# Project](https://spe.org/en/csp/). Simulation of CO2 can be challenging, and
# we load the HYPRE package to improve performance.
#
# The model also has an option to run immiscible simulations with otherwise
# identical PVT behavior. This is often faster to run, but lacks the dissolution
# model present in the compositional version (i.e. no solubility of CO2 in
# brine, and no vaporization of water in the vapor phase).
