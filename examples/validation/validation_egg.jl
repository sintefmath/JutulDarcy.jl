# # The Egg model: Two-phase oil-water model
# A two-phase model that is taken from the first member of the EGG ensemble. The
# model is a synthetic case with channelized permeability and water injection
# with fixed controls. For more details, see the paper where the ensemble is
# introduced:

# simulation." Geoscience Data Journal 1.2 (2014): 192-195.](https://doi.org/10.1002/gdj3.21)
