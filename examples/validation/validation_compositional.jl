# # Validation of equation-of-state compositional flow
# This example solves a 1D two-phase, three component miscible displacement
# problem and compares against existing simulators (E300, AD-GPRS) to verify
# correctness.
#
# The case is loaded from an input file that can be run in other simulators. For
# convenience, we provide solutions from the other simulators as a binary file
# to perform a comparison without having to run and convert results from other
# the simulators.
#
# This case is a small compositional problem inspired by the examples in Voskov
# et al (JPSE, 2012). A 1D reservoir of 1,000 meters length is discretized into
# 1,000 cells. The model initially contains a mixture made up of 0.6 parts C10,
# 0.1 parts CO2, and 0.3 parts C1 by moles at 150 degrees C and 75 bar pressure.
# Wells are placed in the leftmost and rightmost cells of the domain, with the
# leftmost well injecting pure CO$_2$ at a fixed bottom-hole pressure of 100 bar
# and the other well producing at 50 bar. The model is isothermal and contains a
# phase transition from the initial two-phase mixture to single-phase gas as
# injected CO$_2$ eventually displaces the resident fluids. For further details
# on this setup, see Møyner and Tchelepi (SPE J. 2018)
# [moyner_tchelepi_2018](@cite).
