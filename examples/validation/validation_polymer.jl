# # Polymer injection in a 2D black-oil reservoir model
# <tags: Blackoil, Tracers, Validation, InputFile>
# This example validates a small polymer model taken from the OPM-tests
# repository. The model is a 2D black-oil reservoir model with polymer
# injection. Adding polymer to the water phase increases the viscosity of the
# water and helps with mobility control. This is implemented in JutulDarcy as a
# tracer that can alter the properties of the system.
#
# At present, the JutulDarcy polymer model supports the following features:
# - Polymer injection in the water phase
# - Varying degree of mixing between polymer and water
# - Adsorption of polymer to the rock
# - Polymer viscosity changes
# - Permeability reduction from polymer
# - Dead pore space for polymer part of water phase
#
# Note that non-Newtonian / shear effectsare not yet implemented in the polymer
# model.
