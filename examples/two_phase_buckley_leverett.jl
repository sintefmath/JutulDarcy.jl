# # Buckley-Leverett two-phase problem
# The Buckley-Leverett test problem is a classical reservoir simulation
# benchmark that demonstrates the nonlinear displacement process of a viscous
# fluid being displaced by a less viscous fluid, typically taken to be water
# displacing oil.
#
# ## Problem definition
#
# This is a simple model without wells, where the flow is driven by a simple
# source term and a simple constant pressure boundary condition at the outlet.
# We define a function that sets up a two-phase system, a simple 1D domain and
# replaces the default relative permeability functions with quadratic functions:
#
# ``k_{r\alpha}(S) = \min \left(\frac{S - S_r}{1 - S_r}, 1\right)^n, S_r = 0.2,
# n = 2``
#
# In addition, the phase viscosities are treated as constant parameters of 1 and
# 5 centipoise for the displacing and resident fluids, respectively.
#
# The function is parametrized on the number of cells and the number of
# time-steps used to solve the model. This function, since it uses a relatively
# simple setup without wells, uses the `Jutul` functions directly.

# increase the number of cells at the cost of increasing the runtime a bit. Note
# that most of the time is spent in the linear solver, which uses a direct
# sparse LU factorization by default. For larger problems it is recommended to
# use an iterative solver. The high-level interface used in later examples
# automatically sets up an iterative solver with the appropriate preconditioner.
