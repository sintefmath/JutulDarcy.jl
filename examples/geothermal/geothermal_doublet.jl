# # Geothermal doublet
# This example demonstrates how to set up a geothermal doublet simulation using

# geology. Instead of using the original wells, we set up a simple
# injector-producer doublet, placed so that injected fluids will sweep a large
# part of the reservoir.

# density, viscosity and heat capacity depend on pressure and temperature.

# ## Compare results
# A key performace metric for geothermal doublets is the time it takes before
# the cold water injected to uphold pressure reaches the producer. At this
# point, production temperature will rapidly decline, so that the breakthrough
# time effectively defines the lifespan of the doublet. We plot the well results
# for the two simulations to compare the two different PVT formulations. Since
# water viscosty is not affected by temperature in the simple PVT model, water
# movement is much faster in this scenario, thereby grossly underestimating the
# lifespan of the doublet compared to the realistic PVT. This effect is further
# amplified by the thermal shrinkage due to colling present in the realistic PVT
# model.

# Finally, we plot the density to see how the two simulations differ. As density
# in the the simple PVT is only dependent on pressure, it is largely constant
# except from in the vicinity of the wells, where pressure gradients are larger.
# In the realistic PVT, where density is a function of both pressure and
# temperature, we see that it is affected in all regions swept by the injected
# cold water.
