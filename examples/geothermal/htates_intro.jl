# # High-temperature Aquifer Thermal Energy Storage (HT-ATES)
# <tags: Geothermal>
# This example demonstrates how to simulate high-temperature aquifer thermal
# energy storage. We set up a simple case describing a vertical slice of a
# reservoir with an a main (hot) well near the left boundary, and a supporting
# (cold) well near the right boundary. The reservoir has boundarys condition
# that provides a constant pressure and temperature. We set up a yearly cycle
# where energy is stored from June to September, and discharged from December to
# March. The rest of the year is a rest period where no energy is stored or
# produced.
