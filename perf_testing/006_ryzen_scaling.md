# 006 — Ryzen 7950X continuation (2026-10-21)

## Starting point and objective

Local `sol-perf-2` branches start at Jutul `d24bcbcc` and JutulDarcy
`e9292fbd`. In these Windows checkouts the SINTEF remote is named `upstream`;
the `origin` forks do not contain `sol-perf`. No pushes are authorized.
Earlier numbered results were measured on an Apple M4 Pro; do not combine
their absolute times with this workstation's results.

Target: at least 4x warmed simulation throughput at 15 Julia workers relative
to one worker on this Ryzen 9 7950X (16 cores / 32 hardware threads). Use refined
Olympus and Norne, with the first 20% of report intervals at their original
durations for final validation. Short three-day fixtures are diagnostic only.
BLAS stays single threaded, CPU benchmark processes run sequentially, and
warm-up is separate. Record convergence, iteration counts, phase timings,
allocations, source commits, and complete final pressure/saturation comparisons.
Compare fixed solver settings as well as the application defaults.

`PERF_FRACTION=0.2` selects the first ceil(20% * report count) intervals and
disables the one-day cap unless `PERF_MAX_DAYS` is explicitly supplied.
The benchmark environment now points at the sibling `.jl` checkouts used here;
MultiComponentFlash is registry-resolved rather than requiring a fourth checkout.

## Investigation queue

1. Reproduce one/15-worker refined baselines and inspect phase profiles.
2. Audit assembly, properties, state updates, convergence reductions, sparse
   products, Krylov operations, CPR/AMG construction and application, ILU,
   wells, allocation/GC, and output for serial work or scheduling costs.
3. Measure small changes individually with the existing interfaces and
   Polyester where appropriate; retain numerical comparisons and rejected probes.
4. Verify complete 20% schedules, intermediate worker counts, correctness
   checks, and commit each supported improvement without pushing.

Results pending.
