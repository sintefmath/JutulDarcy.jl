!!! info "Note about units"
    JutulDarcy does currently not make us of conversion factors or explicit
    units can in principle use any consistent unit system. Some default scaling
    of variables assume that the magnitude pressures and velocities roughly
    match that of strict SI (e.g. Pascals and cubic meters per second). These
    scaling factors are primarily used when iterative linear solvers are used.
