# Getting started

## Installing JutulDarcy

To get started with JutulDarcy, you must install [the Julia programming language](https://julialang.org/). We recommend the latest stable release, but at least version 1.9 is required. Julia uses environments to manage packages. If you are not familiar with this concept, we recommend the [Pkg documentation](https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/environments/).

### Setting up an environment

To set up an environment you can create a folder and open Julia with that project as a runtime argument. The environment is persistent: If you start Julia in the same folder with the same project argument, the same packages will be installed. For this reason, it is sufficient to do this process once.

```bash
mkdir jutuldarcy_env
cd jutuldarcy_env
julia --project=.
```

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("JutulDarcy")
```

You can then run any of the examples in the [`examples`](https://github.com/sintefmath/JutulDarcy.jl/tree/main/examples) directory by including them. The examples are sorted by complexity. We suggest you start with [Your first JutulDarcy.jl simulation](@ref).

To generate a folder that contains the examples locally, you can run the following code to create a folder `jutuldarcy_examples` in your current working directory:

```julia
using JutulDarcy
generate_jutuldarcy_examples()
```

Alternatively, a folder can be specified if you want the examples to be placed outside your present working directory:

```julia
using JutulDarcy
generate_jutuldarcy_examples("/home/username/")
```

```@docs
generate_jutuldarcy_examples
```

### Adding additional packages

We also rely heavily on the Jutul base package for some functionality, so we recommend that you also install it together with JutulDarcy:

```julia
Pkg.add("Jutul")
```

If you want the plotting used in the examples, you need this:

```julia
Pkg.add("GLMakie") # 3D and interactive visualization
```

Some examples and functionaltiy also make use of additional packages:

```julia
Pkg.add("Optim") # Optimization library
Pkg.add("HYPRE") # Better linear solver
Pkg.add("GeoEnergyIO") # Parsing input files
```
