# Welcome to the JutulDarcy.jl documentation

JutulDarcy.jl: Darcy-scale and subsurface flow (CO2 sequestration, gas/H2 storage, oil/gas fields) using [Jutul.jl](https://github.com/sintefmath/Jutul.jl) developed by the [Applied Computational Science group](https://www.sintef.no/en/digital/departments-new/applied-mathematics/applied-computational-sciences/) at [SINTEF Digital](https://www.sintef.no/en/digital/).

## Installation

Install [Julia](https://julialang.org/) and add the following packages together
with a Makie backend library to your environment of choice using Julia's package manager `Pkg`:

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("GLMakie")    # Plotting
Pkg.add("Jutul")      # Base package
Pkg.add("JutulDarcy") # Reservoir simulator
```

You can then run any of the examples in the [`examples`](https://github.com/sintefmath/JutulDarcy.jl/tree/main/examples) directory by including them. The examples are sorted by complexity. We suggest you start with [Intro: Gravity segregation example](Intro: Gravity segregation example).

To generate a folder that contains the examples locally, you can run the following code to create a folder `jutuldarcy_examples` in your current working directory:

```julia
using JutulDarcy
generate_jutuldarcy_examples()
```

If you want a quick start, we also have a minimal example that runs a industry standard input file and produces interactive plots:

::: details Show me the code

```@example
using JutulDarcy, GLMakie
spe9_dir = JutulDarcy.GeoEnergyIO.test_input_file_path("SPE9")
file_path = joinpath(spe9_dir, "SPE9.DATA")
case = setup_case_from_data_file(file_path)
result = simulate_reservoir(case)
plot_reservoir_simulation_result(case.model, result)
```
:::

Note that interactive plotting requires `GLMakie`, which may not work if you are running Julia over SSH.
