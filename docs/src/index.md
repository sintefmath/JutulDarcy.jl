## What is this?

JutulDarcy.jl is a general high-performance purpose porous media simulator toolbox (CO2 sequestration, gas/H2 storage, oil/gas fields) written in [Julia](https://julialang.org/) based on [Jutul.jl](https://github.com/sintefmath/Jutul.jl), developed by the [Applied Computational Science group](https://www.sintef.no/en/digital/departments-new/applied-mathematics/applied-computational-sciences/) at [SINTEF Digital](https://www.sintef.no/en/digital/).

A few highlights:

- Immiscible, black-oil, compositional, CO2-brine and geothermal systems
- Fully differentiable through adjoint method
- High performance, with optional support for compiling MPI parallel binaries
- Consistent discretizations
- Industry standard input formats - or make your own model as a script
- 3D visualization and tools for post-processing of simulation results

## Quick start guide

[Getting started](man/intro) is the main setup guide that includes the basics of installing Julia and creating a Julia environment for `JutulDarcy.jl`, written for users who may not already be familiar with Julia package management.

If you want to get started quickly: Install [Julia](https://julialang.org/) and add the following packages together
with a Makie backend library to your environment of choice using Julia's package manager `Pkg`:

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("GLMakie")    # Plotting
Pkg.add("Jutul")      # Base package
Pkg.add("JutulDarcy") # Reservoir simulator
```

To verify that everything is working, we have a minimal example that runs a industry standard input file and produces interactive plots. Note that interactive plotting requires `GLMakie`, which may not work if you are running Julia over SSH.

::: details Show me the code

```@example
using JutulDarcy, GLMakie
spe9_dir = JutulDarcy.GeoEnergyIO.test_input_file_path("SPE9")
file_path = joinpath(spe9_dir, "SPE9.DATA")
case = setup_case_from_data_file(file_path)
result = simulate_reservoir(case)
plot_reservoir_simulation_result(case.model, result)
```
:::

To get access to all the examples, you can generate a folder that contains the examples locally, you can run the following code to create a folder `jutuldarcy_examples` in your current working directory:

```julia
using JutulDarcy
generate_jutuldarcy_examples()
```

These examples can then be run using `include("jutuldarcy_examples/example_name.jl")` or opened in an editor to be run line by line. Alternatively, you can download all examples as [Jupyter Notebooks](https://github.com/sintefmath/JutulDarcy.jl/tree/gh-pages/dev/examples).
